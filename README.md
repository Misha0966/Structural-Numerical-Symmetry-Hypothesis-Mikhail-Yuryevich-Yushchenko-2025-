## Hypothesis of Structural Numerical Symmetry: A Study of Integer Properties Under Symmetric Partitioning and Partial Multiplication.

## Abstract

This paper presents a new pattern in number theory ‚Äî the hypothesis of structural numerical symmetry , discovered by me on May 4, 2025. The essence of it is as follows:

In the decimal numeral system, for any integer N‚â•10, if it is split into m‚â•2 natural parts that are as equal in length as possible (so that the lengths of all parts differ by at most one digit), where m‚ààN but does not exceed the length of the number N, and each part is then multiplied by the same natural number k, and the results are 
concatenated to form a new decimal number PQ, then:

There may be a complete match: PQ=N√ók

Either the beginning or the end can match, even if the numbers PQ and N√ók have different lengths.

There may be partial symmetry: only the beginning or the end matches.

Even prime numbers can yield an exact match under specific partitioning and multiplier conditions.

Question: Is there any number N for which none of these rules apply?

## Clarification of the formulation:

N‚â•10 ‚Äî this is the minimum length that allows actual symmetric partitioning

Partitioning into m parts ‚Äî must be as equal in length as possible

Multiplying each part by a natural number k

Concatenating the results as a decimal number PQ ‚Äî key operation that gives structure

Matches can be:

Complete

Partial (beginning or end)

Scaled (e.g., they differ by a factor of 10 or more)

### The paper includes both theoretical analysis and a programmatic implementation in Julia, enabling automated verification of the hypothesis across arbitrary ranges. 

The work includes both theoretical analysis and a software implementation in the Julia programming language, which allows automatic verification of the hypothesis across any range of numbers. Directions for further research are also proposed.

## Chapter 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Origin of the Idea:

The research began with an attempt to manually compute 999^9999. This number was too large for direct analysis, prompting an alternative approach ‚Äî breaking it into segments and applying partial multiplication. Although this method initially produced numerous errors, continued experimentation led to the discovery of this unique hypothesis.

### 1.2 Research Objective:

The main goal was to investigate what can be formulated as the Hypothesis of Structural Numerical Symmetry , including:

Understanding under what conditions exact or partial matching occurs

Identifying patterns

Implementing a program for mass verification of the hypothesis

Testing applicability to prime numbers

## Chapter 2. Hypothesis Formulation

### 2.1 Structural Numerical Symmetry Hypothesis (SNS)

In the decimal numeral system, for any integer N‚â•10, if it is split into m‚â•2 natural parts that are as equal in length as possible (so that the lengths of all parts differ by at most one digit), where m‚ààN but does not exceed the length of the number N, and each part is then multiplied by the same natural number k, and the results are 
concatenated to form a new decimal number PQ, then:

There may be a complete match: PQ=N√ók

Either the beginning or the end can match, even if the numbers PQ and N√ók have different lengths.

There may be partial symmetry: only the beginning or the end matches.

Even prime numbers can yield an exact match under specific partitioning and multiplier conditions.

Question: Is there any number N for which none of these rules apply?

## Chapter 3. Theoretical Analysis

### 3.1 Condition for Exact Match
An exact match is possible only when multiplying each segment Ai * k does not increase the number of digits.

Formal condition:

‚àÄi, length(Ai * k) = length(Ai) ‚áí PQ = N * k

### 3.2 Dependence on Multiplier k

Observations:

At k=1: Structure remains unchanged ‚Üí always exact match

At k=7: Often leads to full or partial match

At k=4,6,8: More likely to produce scaled matches

## Chapter 6. Data Analysis and Conclusions

### 6.1 Observations
Exact match is rare but real

Partial symmetry is the most common phenomenon

Prime numbers also satisfy the hypothesis under certain conditions

### 6.2 Conclusions

The Structural Numerical Symmetry Hypothesis is not random

It follows strict rules related to digit length and multiplication of least/most significant digits

This pattern may be useful in:

Number theory

Educational purposes

Large number analysis

Potential further research directions:

Identify classes of numbers yielding full match at given k

Generalize to other numeral systems

Analyze behavior at higher powers

Integrate into mathematical software (Julia, Mathematica, Python)
